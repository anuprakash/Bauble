# Bauble
Bauble is a dock launcher written in C# utilizing WPF. As a launcher, it contains an animated list application icons, and will open their program on click.

## Project Roots
[RocketDock](http://www.rocketdock.com/) is an amazing piece of well written software. Unfortunately it is unsupported on Windows 7 64bit. Development has slowed to the point where it is reasonable to say there likely will not be another release for it in the near future, and many of the plugins written for it have significant bugs and are no longer supported by their authors.

Bauble attempts to be a functional replacement for RocketDock. There are many areas where Bauble does not meet this goal yet, but we are working to add features so that we can reach functional parity.

## Project Roadmap
The [project roadmap](https://github.com/cyberknet/Bauble/wiki/Project-Roadmap) is defined in the wiki with the proposed feature list.

## Themes
Bauble does not support RocketDock themes, but does provide a theming interface of its own. There are currently two themes. For more information regarding creating themes, please see the [Theme Documentation](https://github.com/cyberknet/Bauble/wiki/Icons.XML-File-Documentation)
